        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>iOS Developer, Neighbor Storage; Lehi, Utah — August 2020 - Present</h3>
        <p>Updated most of the layout to use SwiftUI, pairing with UI designers to match the new design system. Implemented various feature iterations for A/B testing to improve conversion rates. Updated network layer to use Compose and then Swift’s built-in concurrency. In addition to iOS development, I worked across multiple platforms including backend (Ruby), front end (Typescript, React), Android (Kotlin, XML, Compose) to accomplish pressing business needs.</p>

        <h3>iOS Developer, Lucid Software; South Jordan, Utah — May 2018 - August 2020</h3>
        <p>Implemented a new document rendering engine, supported by Core Animation, to replace the web renderer. Additionally, I wrote a custom shader in Metal Shader Language for rendering a document grid.</p>

        <h3>iOS Developer Intern, Lucid Software; South Jordan, Utah — May 2017 - August 2017</h3>
        <p>Worked on many new app features including new document sharing UI and a customer feedback prompt using UIKit.</p>

        <h3>Full Stack Developer, Whistic, Provo, Utah — April 2016 - December 2016</h3>
        <p>Whistic was an early stage startup working to improve security risk management of third party vendors for enterprise companies. I worked to implement new feature with AngularJS and the Spring Framework.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy programming creatively and seeing the results of my work. I love learning new programming languages and can usually pick up the basics of a new one in about a week. I love classical music and I like to learn new piano sonatas or ragtime songs. I also enjoy being creative in the kitchen. My signature creation is “bacon-wrapped, deep-fried guacamole.”</p>
